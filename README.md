# PBPK_host-microbiome_model

Pharmacokinetic Multi-Compartment Modeling

The multi-compartment pharmacokinetic model of drug metabolism in the mouse to separate host and microbial contributions 
to systemic metabolite exposure. The model contains 7 main compartments (small intestine I-III, cecum, colon, feces, and serum).

The code is developed with MatLab2017 SimBiology pipeline and is distributed under the terms of the GNU 
General Public License (please read copyright_and_license and LICENSE files for details. 

Example workflow is provided in the file pbpk_host_microbiome_workflow_1.

Example workflow pbpk_host_microbiome_workflow_2 contains an extended PBPK host-microbiome model with enterohepatic circulation and three drug metabolites. 

Folder Insights_from_PBPK_models contains simulation workflows to assess the effect of microbiota on the systemic drug and metabolite levels under conditions of altered host physiology (small and large intestine permeability), microbiota drug-metabolizing activity or enterohepatic circulation. 

This model is part of the work by Michael Zimmermann, Maria Zimmermann-Kogadeeva, Rebekka Wegmann and Andrew L. Goodman.
