# PBPK_host-microbiome_model

Pharmacokinetic Multi-Compartment Modeling

The multi-compartment pharmacokinetic model of drug metabolism in the mouse to separate host and microbial contributions 
to systemic metabolite exposure. The model contains 7 main compartments (small intestine I-III, cecum, colon, feces, and serum).
